# Bike-Sales-Visualizations-Lab
 Overview
This repository contains the results and source data from an Excel lab focused on sales data analysis and professional visualization. The project analyzes historical bike sales figures to uncover trends in revenue, profit, product performance, and customer demographics (specifically age groups and countries).

This demonstrates proficiency in preparing data for charting and creating impactful, business-oriented dashboards in Excel.

💾 Project Data Sources
The analysis and visualizations are built upon the following datasets, which are included in this repository (likely as different sheets in the original Excel workbook):


Sales Data.csv: The primary, granular sales transaction data.

✨ Key Skills and Visualizations Demonstrated
The project focuses heavily on data presentation and is assumed to showcase the following advanced Excel skills:

I. Data Preparation

Data Summarization: Preparing source data (using Pivot Tables or aggregation functions) to create clear, chart-ready tables.

Data Segmentation: Breaking down total sales metrics by relevant dimensions (Year, Product, Country, Age Group).

II. Visualization Techniques

Time Series Analysis: Creating charts (e.g., Line Charts) to visualize Revenue and Profit trends over the years.

Comparative Analysis: Utilizing charts (e.g., Bar Charts) to compare Product Revenue by Country to see which products sell best in different regions.


Demographic Insights: Using charts (e.g., Pie or Column Charts) to visualize Revenue by Age Group and identify the most valuable customer segments.

Dashboard Creation (Implied): Combining multiple charts and slicers onto a single dashboard sheet for interactive analysis.
